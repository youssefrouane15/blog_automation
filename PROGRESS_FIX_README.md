# Progress Tracking Bug Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The progress tracking system was experiencing the following issues:
1. Keywords were being tracked multiple times (duplicates)
2. Progress bars showing 200% or more instead of capping at 100%
3. Inconsistent state management between frontend and backend
4. Background tasks continuing to run even after reset

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Duplicate Keyword Tracking
- Keywords were stored in a list that allowed duplicates
- No validation to prevent the same keyword from being added multiple times
- Keywords could be re-added when status changed from "processing" to "completed"

### 2. Progress Calculation Issues
- Progress was calculated based on the duplicated keyword list
- No cap on the progress percentage, allowing it to exceed 100%
- Completed count could exceed total keywords

### 3. Background Task Management
- Old background tasks weren't cancelled when starting new ones
- The `/start-process` endpoint created a new progress tracker but didn't clean up running tasks
- No tracking of tasks by website name for proper cleanup

### 4. Frontend State Sync
- Frontend polling interval was set to 10 seconds (too slow)
- No immediate feedback when starting/stopping processing

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (main.py)

1. **Progress Tracker Improvements**
   - Changed `keywords` from list to set to prevent duplicates
   - Added `keywords_list` to maintain order for display
   - Added `processed_keywords` set to track completed/failed keywords
   - Added thread-safe lock for concurrent access
   - Capped progress at 100% and counts at total keywords

2. **Background Task Management**
   - Added `background_tasks_by_website` dictionary to track tasks per website
   - Cancel existing tasks before starting new ones
   - Proper cleanup in `/start-process` endpoint
   - Added duplicate prevention in `process_website_background`

3. **Key Method Changes**
   ```python
   # In ProgressTracker.__init__
   self._lock = asyncio.Lock()  # Thread safety
   
   # In start_website
   "keywords": set(),  # Prevent duplicates
   "keywords_list": [],  # Maintain order
   "processed_keywords": set()  # Track completed
   
   # In complete_keyword
   if keyword in stats["processed_keywords"]:
       self.logger.warning(f"Keyword '{keyword}' already processed...")
       return
   ```

### Frontend Changes (index.html)

1. **Polling Interval**
   - Changed from 10 seconds to 3 seconds for more responsive updates

2. **Reset Button**
   - Changed "Refresh all websites" to "Reset All Progress"
   - Added proper state cleanup before refresh
   - Added immediate progress update after reset

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_progress_fix.py
```

The test script validates:
- Duplicate keyword prevention
- Progress calculation accuracy
- Proper state reset
- Progress capping at 100%

## Usage Notes

1. **Starting Processing**
   - Click "Start" on individual website cards
   - Previous tasks are automatically cancelled
   - Progress starts fresh from 0%

2. **Resetting Progress**
   - Click "Reset All Progress" to clear all states
   - All background tasks are cancelled
   - Fresh progress tracker instance is created

3. **Monitoring**
   - Progress updates every 3 seconds
   - Each website shows unique keywords only
   - Progress bar caps at 100%

## Future Improvements

1. Add persistent storage for progress state
2. Implement resume functionality for interrupted processing
3. Add detailed error tracking per keyword
4. Implement batch processing limits
5. Add progress history/logs viewer

## Troubleshooting

If you still see duplicate keywords or >100% progress:
1. Restart the application
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check logs for any error messages
4. Ensure only one instance is running
5. Verify config.json has unique website names
